# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-07

### âœ¨ Added

- Initial release of `@zyrab/domo-ssg`, a simple static site generator designed for Domo-based virtual DOM.
- Support for custom layout rendering via `renderLayout()` function.
- Recursive route tree traversal using a virtual DOM structure.
- Automatic generation of `sitemap.xml` with support for `baseUrl` and `exclude` filters.
- Optional `domo.config.js` for user-defined config overrides (`outDir`, `routesFile`, `layout`, etc).
- Filesystem-safe output path handling for route-based pages.
- Clean output directory before build.
- Auto-injection of client-side JavaScript per page via extracted `on(...)` event metadata from virtual DOM.

### ðŸ§  Server-side event delegation support

- Virtual `.on(...)`, `.onClosest(...)`, `.onMatch(...)` handlers now capture metadata during SSG.
- `event-utils.js` extracts and serializes event listeners for runtime hydration:
  - Supports event type `direct`, `closest`, and `match`.
  - Functions can expose variables using `// @ssg-let` and `// @ssg-const` to ensure availability in hydrated JS.
  - Closure support and selector-aware event bindings.

### ðŸ“¦ Monorepo & Build

- Designed to work inside monorepos via `pnpm workspaces`.
- CLI support via `node src/index.js` for both root and filtered workspace usage.
- Package is `type: module` and compatible with ESM.

Let me know if you want to split it into smaller versions (like `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, etc.) to reflect earlier development stages before `0.1.0`.

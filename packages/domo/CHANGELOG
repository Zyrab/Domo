# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-04-21

### Added

- Initial release of `@zyrab/domo`
- DOM builder with chainable syntax
- Lightweight router with nested routes and history API support
- MIT license

## [1.0.1] - 2025-04-21

### Added

- `DSVG` factory function for creating and manipulating SVG elements
  - Internally extends `Domo` to support SVG-specific behavior
- `Domo` and `DSVG` now expose their underlying classes via `.Class` (e.g. `Domo.Class`, `DSVG.Class`) for easy extension
- Type definitions and JSDoc annotations improved for better IntelliSense and TypeScript compatibility
  - Parameters now correctly typed
  - Factory functions properly infer return types
- `.on()` now supports objects too for multiple eventlisteners adding once

### Changed

- `Domo` is now officially a factory function (no need to use `new`) while remaining extendable via `Domo.Class` or `DomoClass` if prefered using Class directly

## [1.0.2] (2025-04-27)

### Bug Fixes:

Fixed filename casing issues on GitHub and npm: Ensured that all file names are correctly cased to prevent bundling issues in case-sensitive environments (e.g., npm, GitHub, production builds).

## [1.0.3] (2025-05-04)

### Bug Fixes:

Fixed typo in router, where instead of error.message was written err.message that prevented loging an actual error on routing issues.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-05-24

### Changed

- Deferred `<main>` element creation until `router.mount()` is called.  
  This avoids `document is not defined` errors during SSR or SSG environments like `jsdom`.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added

Domo.appendTo(target) — Appends the current element to a passed parent (supports HTMLElement, DocumentFragment, and Domo instances).

Domo.parent(target) — Alias for .appendTo() to support a more fluent chainable syntax.

Improved JSDoc and type definitions:

.append(), .child(), .parent(), and .appendTo() now include detailed annotations.

Type-safe support for arrays of DOM nodes, Domo instances, and primitives in child methods.

### Changed

Refactored internal .parent() method to be consistent with chaining behavior.

.append() is now a direct alias for .child() with no functional difference, improving semantic clarity.

\_root document.create method call now happens inside init() previously called in the direct file caused jsdom to throw error when tried to genrate static html files.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed

- Fixed `replace(child, newChild)` method crashing due to duplicate `const` declarations. Now correctly handles both arguments using separate internal variables.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-09

### Added

- Modularized Core: Domo class refactored into smaller, logically separated modules for improved readability, maintainability, and debugging (e.g., Core, Properties, Classes, Events, Children, Builder).

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG) Support: Enhanced virtual DOM creation logic for all methods, ensuring Domo functions correctly in environments where document is not defined.

- Monorepo Integration: Project restructured into a monorepo setup, enhancing management of related packages.

### Removed

- Router Functionality: Router capabilities have been extracted into a separate, dedicated package.

- SVG-Specific Functionality: DSVG factory and related SVG handling have been moved to a distinct package.

### Changed

- JSDoc Enhancements: Further improvements to JSDoc annotations across all methods for better clarity, examples, and type safety, leveraging the new modular structure.

- Internal \_vel Method: Renamed for consistency and clarity in the virtual DOM creation process.

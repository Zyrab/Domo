# Changelog – @zyrab/domo-router

--

## 0.3.0 - 2025-09-26

### Changed

- The router's internal root (\_root) is now the `document.body` instead of a `<main>` element. This gives you full control over the top-level DOM structure.
- You now must define all persistent components like `<header>` and `<footer>` inside your custom layout functions specified in the routes object.

### Added

- Layouts for defining and swapping full page structures. (Still in testing, but the syntax won't change.)
- Outlets for nested routing. (Still in testing, will be improved.)

### Tip

- Use `document.createDocumentFragment()` to wrap your layout. This keeps your DOM clean and semantic by ensuring no extra wrapper `<div>` gets rendered inside the `<body>`.

## Example:

```js
const layouts = {
  default: (component) => {
    const layout = document.createDocumentFragment();
    layout.appendChild(createHeader());
    layout.appendChild(component); // or your <main> wrapper
    layout.appendChild(createFooter());
    return layout;
  },
};
```
